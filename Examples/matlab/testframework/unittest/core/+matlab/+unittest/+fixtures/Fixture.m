classdef Fixture < matlab.unittest.internal.TestContent & matlab.mixin.Heterogeneous
    % Fixture - Interface for test fixtures.
    %
    %   Fixtures provide a means for configuring environment state required for
    %   tests. Classes which derive from the Fixture interface must provide a
    %   setup method which performs the changes to the environment. A fixture
    %   should restore the environment to its initial state when it is torn
    %   down. This can be done using addTeardown in the setup method or by
    %   overriding the teardown method which, by default, does nothing.
    %
    %   Subclasses can set the SetupDescription and TeardownDescription
    %   properties in their constructors to provide descriptions for the
    %   actions performed by the setup and teardown methods, respectively.
    %
    %   A class which derives from Fixture must override isCompatible if its
    %   constructor accepts any input arguments. Fixture subclasses use this
    %   method to define a notion of interchangeability. Two fixture instances
    %   of the same class are considered to be interchangeable if the
    %   isCompatible method returns true. When running multiple TestCase
    %   classes as a single suite, the Test Runner will tear down and set up
    %   shared test fixtures of the same class if isCompatible returns false
    %   (that is, the fixture will not be shared).
