%~   Logical NOT.
%   ~A performs a logical NOT of input array A, and returns an array
%   containing elements set to either logical 1 (TRUE) or logical 0 (FALSE).
%   An element of the output array is set to 1 if A contains a zero value
%   element at that same array location.  Otherwise, that element is set to
%   0.
%
%   B = NOT(A) is called for the syntax '~A' when A is an object.
%
%   ~ can also be used to ignore input arguments in a function definition,
%   and output arguments in a function call.  See "help punct"
