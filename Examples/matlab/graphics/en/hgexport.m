%HGEXPORT  Export a figure.
%   HGEXPORT(H, FILENAME) writes the figure H to FILENAME.
%   
%   On MS Windows if the filename is '-clipboard' then the output
%   is put on the clipboard instead of saved to a file. The 
%   format of the output is determined by the renderer. The
%   painters renderer generates a metafile and the opengl renderer generates a bitmap.
