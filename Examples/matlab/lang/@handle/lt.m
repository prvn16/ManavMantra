%< (LT)   Less than relation for handles.
%   H1 < H2 performs element-wise comparisons between handle arrays H1 and
%   H2.  H1 and H2 must be of the same dimensions unless one is a scalar.
%   The result is a logical array of the same dimensions, where each
%   element is an element-wise < result.
%
%   If one of H1 or H2 is scalar, scalar expansion is performed and the 
%   result will match the dimensions of the array that is not scalar.
%
%   TF = LT(H1, H2) stores the result in a logical array of the same 
%   dimensions.
