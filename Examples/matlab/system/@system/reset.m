%RESET Reset the internal states of a System object
%   reset(OBJ) resets the internal states of System object OBJ to their
%   initial values.
%
%   For many System objects, this method is a no-op. Objects that have
%   internal states will describe in their help what the reset method does
%   for that object.
%
%   The reset method is always a no-op for unlocked System objects, as the
%   states may not be allocated when the object is not locked.
