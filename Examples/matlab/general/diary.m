%DIARY Save text of MATLAB session.
%   DIARY FILENAME causes a copy of all subsequent command window input
%   and most of the resulting command window output to be appended to the
%   named file.  If no file is specified, the file 'diary' is used.
%
%   DIARY OFF suspends it. 
%   DIARY ON turns it back on.
%   DIARY, by itself, toggles the diary state.
%
%   Use the functional form of DIARY, such as DIARY('file'),
%   when the file name is stored in a string.
